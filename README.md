Book Analysis Program This Python program downloads the text of a book from Project Gutenberg, performs text analysis to check if a given name is present in the book, and applies name matching techniques to find close matches for the given name. It also provides insights about the book, such as the most frequent words and a word cloud visualization.

Dependencies To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

requests: To make HTTP requests and download the book text. difflib: To perform name matching and find close matches. nltk: To perform text analysis tasks such as tokenization and frequency counting. wordcloud: To generate word cloud visualizations. matplotlib: To display the generated word cloud image. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

Copy code pip install requests difflib nltk wordcloud matplotlib Usage Download the program file (book_analysis.py) to your local machine. Open the command line or terminal. Navigate to the directory where the program file is saved. Run the program using the following command: Copy code python book_analysis.py Functions download_book_text(url) This function downloads the text of a book from Project Gutenberg using the provided URL.

url (string): The URL of the book text on Project Gutenberg. check_name_presence(book_text, name) This function checks if a given name is present in the book text.

book_text (string): The downloaded book text. name (string): The name to check. find_close_matches(book_text, name) This function finds close matches for a given name in the book text.

book_text (string): The downloaded book text. name (string): The name to find close matches for. find_most_frequent_words(book_text, top_n) This function finds the most frequent words in the book text and displays the top N words.

book_text (string): The downloaded book text. top_n (int): The number of top words to display. generate_word_cloud(book_text) This function generates and displays a word cloud visualization based on the frequency of words in the book text.

book_text (string): The downloaded book text. Example Usage Here's an example of how you can use the program:

python Copy code book_id = 46 book_url = f"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/{book_id}/{book_id}-0.txt"
book_text = download_book_text(book_url)

if book_text: check_name_presence(book_text, "Alice") find_close_matches(book_text, "between") find_most_frequent_words(book_text, 10) generate_word_cloud(book_text) In this example, we download the book with ID 46 from Project Gutenberg and perform various text analysis tasks.
